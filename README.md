## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

üéì **MS in Information Systems @ Northeastern University**

I'm a Software Developer who loves building applications that make life simpler, smarter, and more enjoyable. I have 1.5 years of experience as a Python Developer, where I built and maintained applications, developed solutions on AWS, and collaborated with teams to deliver reliable products.

I enjoy turning ideas into practical, user-friendly solutions. Currently, I'm expanding my skills in full-stack development and cloud technologies, learning how technology, data, and business come together to solve real-world problems.

üå± **When I'm not coding:** Traveling to new places, hiking, or getting lost in anime worlds!
